		<h1>Advancing Medicine: Bench to Bedside</h1>
	<p>In response to the rapid developments in the field of translational medicine, AAAS will be holding its first Science Translational Medicine conference on February 12-15, 2018 in Austin, Texas.</p>

	<p>Since the founding of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> in 2009, research dedicated to bridging the gap between basic research and human health application has accelerated. 
	The speculations and first glimpses at potentially groundbreaking therapies that were featured in our first issue are now becoming reality. 
	In a time when government funding for medical research is uncertain, we feel a dire need to facilitate discussion around the importance of translational biomedical research in advancing healthcare to the next level. 
	We invite members of the biomedical research community to submit proposals for sessions to be featured in our upcoming conference. 
	<b><span style="color: red;">The deadline for all submissions is Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</span> 
	Decisions will be announced in early August 2017 upon completion of peer review and final selection by the Scientific Advisory Board of <i>Science Translational Magazine</i>.</b></p>			

	<h2>About <i>Science Translational Medicine</i></h2>

		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">	
			<i>Science Translational Medicine</i> (<i>STM</i>) is a growing interdisciplinary journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). 
			<i>STM</i> aims to encourage the collaborative, forward-looking mindset that will allow for more efficient applications of basic science to the understanding and treatment of human disease. 
			The journal, available in print and online, features peer-reviewed research articles and commentary from highly regarded experts across all relevant areas of biomedical research. 
		</p>
				
	<h2>Session Formats</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			Similar to the AAAS Annual Symposium, the Translational Medicine Conference will consist of 3 session formats: 90-minute <b>symposium</b>, 90-minute <b>discussion-focused</b>, and 15-minute <b>“flash talk”</b> formats. Detailed descriptions of session types can be found on the AAAS Annual Symposium submission site <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2018/symp/cfp.cgi">here</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			It is highly recommended that 90-minute sessions feature speakers from different disciplines and institutions to provide multiple perspectives on the topic. 
			Successful proposals for 90-minute sessions will define a clear theme and showcase its relevance to a multidisciplinary audience.  
			<a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/160">Past issues</a> of <i>STM</i> have featured research and commentary focused around a central theme, and may serve as useful guides for 90-minute session submissions. 
		</p>
				
		<p>
			Flash talks are meant to introduce the audience to the speaker’s chosen topic. 
			It is recommended that speakers seeking to discuss new research findings or emerging fields submit proposals for this format. 
			The audience of flash talk series will be interested in timely and novel therapies or technologies in the field.
			Examples of topics that best fit the flash talk format can be found in the Focus section of our most <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/by/year/2017">recent issues</a>.
		</p>
				
	<h2>Scientific Sessions</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			In 2015, <i>STM</i> featured a piece by Hawgood et al describing an “inflection point” in precision medicine.
			The same can be said for research across all areas of translational medicine, where cross-disciplinary work is propelling science to the next level. 
			Scientific sessions are meant to be informative and engaging to a multidisciplinary audience.
			Although presentations focused on state-of-the-art research are encouraged, presenters should be aware that audience members may not have an extensive background in the topic.
			Proposals which showcase a specific paper’s broader, practical applications will be given higher consideration over narrow, theoretical research proposals.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>Research topics of particular interest include:</i>
		</p>
		
		<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
			<li>Precision medicine (including targeted therapies, medical imaging, and diagnostics)</li>
			<li>Biomaterials and nanotechnology for drug delivery, implants, and regenerative medicine</li>
			<li>Gene editing and stem cell research</li>
			<li>Big data and computational biology</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			We highly encourage research-centric proposals to include visual media such as videos and images. 
			Media included as supplementary material or figures in previous submissions to <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> will be accepted. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Please note:</b> 
			As this is not a traditional medical conference, presentations solely featuring medical case studies will not be considered. 
			Although the theme of the conference is translational medicine, basic research that is extremely compelling and that elucidates promising therapeutic approaches will be considered. 
			Examples of such research can be found in the Editor’s Choice and Perspective sections of our journal. 
		</p>
		
	<h2>Policy and Education Sessions</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			In the pilot issue of <i>STM</i>, Crowley and Gusella called for a revamp of the infrastructure governing biomedical research. 
			This piece remains highly representative of the journal's ongoing efforts, and is a driving force for the policy and education sessions. 
			These sessions are centered around the current socio-political climate and its effect on translational research. 
			Issues such as funding and societal understanding of translational research have been long-standing topics in the opinionative sections  of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>. 
			As a subset of our journal’s audience includes regulators and policy-makers, this set of sessions will be dedicated towards discussing the social changes and opinions that help and hinder translational efforts. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>Topics of particular interest in these sessions include:</i>
		</p>
		
		<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
			<li>Federal science and healthcare policies</li>
			<li>Regulatory policies for novel therapies and biomaterials</li>
			<li>Social and public engagement in translational medicine </li>
			<li>Higher education surrounding biomedical research </li>
			<li>Methods and barriers in translational research </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			It is recommended that policy and education sessions be submitted for the 90-minute discussion format. 
			Proposals for these sessions will be evaluated for their multifaceted approach to socio-political issues in translational research, as well as their ability to initiate meaningful conversation within the field. 
		</p>
			
			
<h2><a name="instruction"></a>General Instructions for Submission</h2>
		<p style="text-align: center; ">
			<span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">All proposals MUST be submitted through the AAAS submission portal by the deadline. <br>Late submissions will not be considered.</span>
		</p>

			<h1><a name="Step1"></a> Five Steps for Submission</h1>
			<h2><a name="Step1"></a> 1. <u>Set Up Proposal</u></h2>
				<h3>SELECT SESSION TYPE</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Please select the desired session type and adhere to format specifications.</b> The Program Committee reserves the right to accept a proposal contingent on altering the format. 
				</p>
				<p>
				There are three session types: 90-minute <b>symposium</b> format; 90-minute <b>discussion-focused</b> format; and 15-minute <b>"flash talk"</b> format.
				<ul>
					<li><u>90-Minute Symposium Format:</u> This is the standard symposium format. Symposium should be focused on topics and projects with broad appeal and relevancy. A moderated panel composed of 3 speakers give presentations (~20 minutes each), followed by a ~30 minute discussion/Q&A period with the audience. 
					<li><u>90-Minute Discussion-Focused Format:</u> This is a slight variation on the standard symposium format, intended to emphasize discussion and interaction with the audience. Topics where audience input on next steps is desired are encouraged to consider this format. A moderated panel of 2-3 speakers give short presentations (~10 minutes each), followed by a longer (~60 minute) discussion/Q&A period with the audience, either as a full group or in smaller groups. The moderator must be a skilled facilitator; moderator tips and advance support are available. 
					<li><u>15-Minute Flash Talk Format:</u> Flash talks are intended to give individuals the opportunity to provide an introduction to a particular topic or area of research (one speaker only per submission). The Program Committee may group the flash talks by topic or cross-cutting theme, such that 3-5 flash talks may be presented consecutively, followed by a Q&A period with the audience. Video clip of relevant prior talk OR a 3 minute video pitch for your talk are REQUIRED. You may provide either a link/url, or you may upload a video file. 
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>ENTER SESSION INFORMATION</h3>
				
				<h3>TITLE OF PROPOSED SCIENTIFIC SESSION</h3>
				<p>
					<u>Title must include no more than 85 characters, including spaces.</u> When preparing a proposal and the title of the session, organizers are encouraged to be creative and to focus on the interdisciplinary nature of the AAAS Annual Meeting. Please avoid jargon.
				</p>

				<h3>SUBMITTER EMAIL ADDRESS</h3>
				<p>
					Please enter a valid email address where messages can be received and accessed year-round. The submitter will immediately receive an email confirming the initiation of a session proposal.</b>
				</p>

				<!-- <p>
					There is one session type: 90-minute format.  The Program Committee reserves the right to accept a proposal contingent on altering the time requested.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>90-Minute Format: See Section 2.</li>
					
				</ul> -->
			

			<h3>CATEGORY SELECTIONS</h3>
				<p>
					Please select the Primary Subject Category that best describes the overall nature of the proposal. This information is used by the Program Committee to help generate broader scientific session tracks or sub-themes. Also, please select Secondary Subject Categories, which are used to develop the cross-cutting General Subject Index contained in the program book.
				</p>

			<h3>SECTION MEMBER AFFILIATION</h3>
				<p>
					If applicable, indicate the primary AAAS section affiliation of the session organizer.
				</p>

			<h3>DISCIPLINARY SECTIONS CONSULTED? <i>(optional)</i></h3>
				<p>
					Indicate if your proposal has been discussed with an AAAS Section. Consultation is not required; however, sections can provide input to help strengthen a proposal, especially if an organizer is submitting for the first time. Consultation does not imply support or endorsement of a proposal. A list of sections and contacts are available at <a href="http://www.aaas.org/page/sections/" target="_blank">http://www.aaas.org/page/sections/</a>.
				</p>

				

			<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

				<p>
					Provide a clear, succinct synopsis of your proposed scientific session (up to1,500 characters, including spaces) <b>as it would appear in the meeting-program</b>. Avoid the use of report or book references, abbreviations, or technical jargon. Do not repeat the meeting theme’s title in the synopsis. Past Annual Meeting programs are archived at <a href="http://www.aaas.org/annual-meeting/archives/" target="_blank">http://www.aaas.org/annual-meeting/archives</a> and can be a useful source of information.
				</p>

				<p>
					Describe the subject, highlighting the scientific issues, innovations, or research to be addressed. <b>Do not name speakers or the titles of their presentations in the synopsis.</b> Speakers are listed separately along with their presentation titles and descriptions.<!-- (see Step 2) -->.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*Discussion-focused sessions</b> sessions are requested to include in their synopsis whether they plan to hold a moderated, full-group discussion or small group discussions after the presentations. 
				</p>	

			<h3>RELEVANCE TO THEME OR SPECIAL RELEVANCE TO THE AUDIENCE</h3>

				<p>
					Describe how the proposed scientific session relates to the theme (up to 500 characters, including spaces). Almost any topic in science and technology can be related to the theme, and submitters are encouraged to extend their reach by thinking internationally. However, the Program Committee will consider proposals that are not directly related to the theme if they involve ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, and education. 
				</p>

			<h3>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h3>

				<p>
					AAAS requires clear disclosures from all presenters at its Annual Meeting regarding any affiliations, funding sources, or financial holdings that might raise questions of bias or be perceived to have potentially influenced presentation content. You will be asked to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest for your speakers or list conflicts of interest. Speakers will also be asked to provide this information at a later date.
				</p>


			<h3>DIVERSITY STATEMENT</h3>

				<p>
					The Program Committee is particularly interested in proposals that include representation of women, international scientists, and underrepresented minorities. Organizers for 90-minute sessions are strongly encouraged to include such participants, as <b>this is a consideration in the selection of sessions by the Program Committee.</b> After proposal selection, if your proposal is conditionally accepted to be included in the Annual Meeting program, the Program Committee may suggest ways to modify the composition of the session to ensure greater diversity among session participants.
				</p>

			<h2><a name="Step2"></a>2. <u>Add/Edit People</u></h2>

			<h3>EXPLANATION OF ROLES</h3>

				<p>
					<b>Please note:</b> If the organizer or co-organizer will also be participating in the session, each separate role must be entered into the system (e.g., organizer and moderator).
				</p>

				<p>	
					<b><u>Organizer</u></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					A session may have only one organizer. The organizer is the primary person responsible for shaping the topic, coordination, and recruitment of participants. The organizer serves as the primary contact for all communications with AAAS Meetings staff. <b>It is the responsibility of the organizer to submit the proposal to AAAS and ensure that participants, including the co-organizer(s) if there is one, receive all information relevant to their inclusion in the proposal and in the Meeting if the proposal is accepted.</b> After proposal acceptance, as necessary, the organizer may suggest addition, removal, or replacement of participants. However, the organizer is responsible for providing, in a timely manner, information regarding any proposed new participants and the reason for the change to AAAS for final approval.
				</p>

				<p>
					For Flash Talks, the Organizer is likely to be the same person as the speaker, unless someone else is submitting it on their behalf; however, as noted above, each role must be entered separately into the system. <i>Organizer and speaker are the only two roles that apply for Flash Talks.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><u>Speakers</u></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>*90-minute symposia</b> are required to have three (3) speakers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*90-minute discussion-focused sessions</b> may have two (2) or three (3) speakers. <i>Speakers must not all be from the same institution.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*Flash talks</b> have only one (1) speaker per proposal submission. The speaker and organizer may be the same person, or they can be different people. <b>A hyperlink to video of the speaker giving a talk is required.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					<u><b>Other Roles</b></u>
				</p>

				<p>	
					<b>Co-Organizer <i>(optional)</i></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Co-organizers may assist the organizer of a 90-minute session with lining up speakers and ensuring that deadlines are met by session participants. There is a maximum of one (1) co-organizer in addition to the mandatory organizer.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Moderator</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Moderators are optional for the symposium format, and <b>required</b> for the discussion format (no more than one moderator per session). <b>AAAS encourages selecting moderators for their skill and experience in facilitating group discussions.</b> The moderator provides a brief overview, introduces each speaker, and facilitates a general discussion by the audience and speakers through a Q&A session. Moderators do not make presentations, submit abstracts, or have a formal speaking role. Please refer to <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/ModeratorGuidance.pdf">moderator guidance</a> when selecting your moderator. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Discussant <i>(optional)</i></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					A maximum of one (1) discussant for a 90-minute session of either type. Discussants provide a brief review of, or counterpoint to, the main topics or issues covered by the panel. They do not make presentations, submit abstracts, or have a formal speaking role.
				</p>

				<h1><a name="Proposal Review Considerations"></a>Proposal Review Considerations: <u>90-Minute Sessions</u></h1>

					<p>
						The following are considerations that are provided to reviewers. Organizers should carefully follow the instructions for submitting their proposals, which will be evaluated for completeness and clarity. Incomplete proposals (including missing descriptions for the presentations) will not be reviewed. 

						<ol class="numbered">
							<li>Evaluate the proposal in general: Is information adequate for evaluation? Does the proposal clearly describe the session? Is it well organized and coherent? More important, is the proposal complete?</li>
							<li>Evaluate the topic: Is the topic timely? Is it suitable for the AAAS Annual Meeting? Is the topic too narrow for a multidisciplinary audience? The AAAS Annual Meeting Scientific Program Committee is particularly interested in proposals that highlight the theme. However, proposals that are not directly related to the theme will be considered if they involve ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, and education.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the content: Does the proposal cover ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, or education? Does it present new or innovative ideas or approaches to attendees? Is it a policy-related proposal that presents the science underlying policy, or addresses issues of significant importance to research, funding, or collaboration? Consider overall merit and the importance of including the proposed session in the program as well as whether the content is too specialized for an AAAS multidisciplinary audience.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the participants: Are they of a caliber to speak authoritatively on their topic? Is the panel composed of diverse organizations and institutions? Are the presentations integrated and coherent as a group? Does the panel present a balanced perspective?</li>
							<li>Finally, and most important, make an overall judgment about the relative merit of each proposal, expressed as a rank ordering of all the proposals you review, with 1 as the best, 2 the second best, and so on. This rank should be based on the previous four criteria, but it need not be from a mechanical arithmetic average of your communicated scores. Different criteria may figure more or less strongly in your judgment of each proposal, based on the particular nature of that proposal, and this can be reflected in your overall rankings.</li>
