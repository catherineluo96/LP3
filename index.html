		<h1>Advancing Medicine: Bench to Bedside</h1>
	<p>In response to the rapid developments in the field of translational medicine, AAAS will be holding its first Science Translational Medicine conference on February 12-15, 2018 in Austin, Texas.</p>

	<p>Since the founding of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> in 2009, research dedicated to bridging the gap between basic research and human health application has accelerated. 
	The speculations and first glimpses at potentially groundbreaking therapies that were featured in our first issue are now becoming reality. 
	In a time when government funding for medical research is uncertain, we feel a dire need to facilitate discussion around the importance of translational biomedical research in advancing healthcare to the next level. 
	We invite members of the biomedical research community to submit proposals for sessions to be featured in our upcoming conference. 
	<b><span style="color: red;">The deadline for all submissions is Thursday, May 11, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</span> 
	Decisions will be announced in early August 2017 upon completion of peer review and final selection by the Scientific Advisory Board of <i>Science Translational Magazine</i>.</b></p>			

	<h2>About <i>Science Translational Medicine</i></h2>

		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">	
			<i>Science Translational Medicine</i> (<i>STM</i>) is a growing interdisciplinary journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). 
			<i>STM</i> aims to encourage the collaborative, forward-looking mindset that will allow for more efficient applications of basic science to the understanding and treatment of human disease. 
			The journal, available in print and online, features peer-reviewed research articles and commentary from highly regarded experts across all relevant areas of biomedical research. 
		</p>
				
	<h2>Session Formats</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			Similar to the AAAS Annual Symposium, the Translational Medicine Conference will consist of 3 session formats: 90-minute <b>symposium</b>, 90-minute <b>discussion-focused</b>, and 15-minute <b>“flash talk”</b> formats. Detailed descriptions of session types can be found on the AAAS Annual Symposium submission site <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2018/symp/cfp.cgi">here</a>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			It is highly recommended that 90-minute sessions feature speakers from different disciplines and institutions to provide multiple perspectives on the topic. 
			Successful proposals for 90-minute sessions will define a clear theme and showcase its relevance to a multidisciplinary audience.  
			<a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/160">Past issues</a> of <i>STM</i> have featured research and commentary focused around a central theme, and may serve as useful guides for 90-minute session submissions. 
		</p>
				
		<p>
			Flash talks are meant to introduce the audience to the speaker’s chosen topic. 
			It is recommended that speakers seeking to discuss new research findings or emerging fields submit proposals for this format. 
			The audience of flash talk series will be interested in timely and novel therapies or technologies in the field.
			Examples of topics that best fit the flash talk format can be found in the Focus section of our most <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/by/year/2017">recent issues</a>.
		</p>
				
	<h2>Scientific Sessions</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			In 2015, <i>STM</i> featured a piece by Hawgood et al describing an “inflection point” in precision medicine.
			The same can be said for research across all areas of translational medicine, where cross-disciplinary work is propelling science to the next level. 
			Scientific sessions are meant to be informative and engaging to a multidisciplinary audience.
			Although presentations focused on state-of-the-art research are encouraged, presenters should be aware that audience members may not have an extensive background in the topic.
			Proposals which showcase a specific paper’s broader, practical applications will be given higher consideration over narrow, theoretical research proposals.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>Research topics of particular interest include:</i>
			
			<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
				<li>Precision medicine (including targeted therapies, medical imaging, and diagnostics)</li>
				<li>Biomaterials and nanotechnology for drug delivery, implants, and regenerative medicine</li>
				<li>Gene editing and stem cell research</li>
				<li>Big data and computational biology</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We highly encourage research-centric proposals to include visual media such as videos and images. 
			Media included as supplementary material or figures in previous submissions to <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> will be accepted. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>Please note:</b> 
			As this is not a traditional medical conference, presentations solely featuring medical case studies will not be considered. 
			Although the theme of the conference is translational medicine, basic research that is extremely compelling and that elucidates promising therapeutic approaches will be considered. 
			Examples of such research can be found in the Editor’s Choice and Perspective sections of our journal. 
		</p>
		
	<h2>Policy and Education Sessions</h2>
		<p style="margin-top:-10px;">
			In the pilot issue of <i>STM</i>, Crowley and Gusella called for a revamp of the infrastructure governing biomedical research. 
			This piece remains highly representative of the journal's ongoing efforts, and is a driving force for the policy and education sessions. 
			These sessions are centered around the current socio-political climate and its effect on translational research. 
			Issues such as funding and societal understanding of translational research have been long-standing topics in the opinionative sections  of <i>Science Translational Medicine</i>. 
			As a subset of our journal’s audience includes regulators and policy-makers, this set of sessions will be dedicated towards discussing the social changes and opinions that help and hinder translational efforts. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<i>Topics of particular interest in these sessions include:</i>
	
			<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
				<li>Federal science and healthcare policies</li>
				<li>Regulatory policies for novel therapies and biomaterials</li>
				<li>Social and public engagement in translational medicine </li>
				<li>Higher education surrounding biomedical research </li>
				<li>Methods and barriers in translational research </li>
			</ul>	
		</p>	
		
		<p>
			It is recommended that policy and education sessions be submitted for the 90-minute discussion format. 
			Proposals for these sessions will be evaluated for their multifaceted approach to socio-political issues in translational research, as well as their ability to initiate meaningful conversation within the field. 
		</p>
			
			
	<h2><a name="instruction"></a>General Instructions for Submission</h2>
		<p>
		We welcome proposals for sessions featuring speakers and topics that span all fields of biomedical research. 
		As exemplified by the diverse readership and editorial staff at <i>STM</i>, it is our belief that innovation is best achieved through multidisciplinary collaboration and community engagement. 
		<br>
		It is NOT required for speakers to be members of AAAS or subscribers to <i>STM</i>. 
		Please note however, that should you wish to submit your work for publication to our journal after it has been presented at this conference, <i>STM</i>’s consideration of the paper may be affected. 
		</p>

		<h3>Note on speakers</h3>
			<p>
			In addition to the relevance and multidisciplinary reach of the submitted content, the speakers’ expertise and ability will also be evaluated. 
			As such, it is imperative that all information outlined in the AAAS annual meeting submission portal (linked below) be provided in order to verify the speaker’s caliber. 
			</p>

		<h3>Note on conflicts of interest</h3>
			<p>
			AAAS and <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> require clear disclosure of any and all affiliations, funding sources, or financial holdings which may be perceived to have influenced the presented material. 
			Speakers will be asked to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest or to list all conflicts of interest. 
			</p>
			
		<p style="text-align: center; ">
			<span style="color: red; font-style: italic;">All proposals MUST be submitted through the AAAS submission portal by the deadline. <br>Late submissions will not be considered.</span>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For detailed information on session formats and evaluation criteria, please refer to the AAAS annual meeting submissions page <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/2018/symp/cfp.cgi#review">here</a>.
