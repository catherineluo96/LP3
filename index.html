			<h1>2018 Theme<br>Advancing Science: Discovery to Application</h1>
	<p>In extraordinary times, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) must come together to advance science with particular force. This conviction is in the organization's DNA. In 1851, AAAS' third president Alexander Dallas Bache said, "While science is without organization, it is without power." Now, as then, we must work together with renewed energy across the full spectrum of the scientific enterprise—and across the sectors that advance it.</p>

<p>The scientific enterprise embraces a broad spectrum of activities, from fundamental research to advanced applications. Academia, government, and industry all perform critical roles in moving ideas into innovations. The demands of the twenty-first century, including improved access to sufficient food, clean water, sustainable energy, and health care, can only be met by accelerating discovery and the translation of discovery into applications. Robust, sustained investments across the full spectrum of the scientific enterprise are essential for developing products that improve the human condition and drive economic growth. We can speed progress by amplifying collaboration across sectors and disciplines. What new avenues for interaction between basic and applied research might be explored? How can we encourage broader participation from every sector and demographic to meet today’s needs and to help invent the future?</p>			

	<h2>Proposal Submission</h2>
		<p>
The AAAS Annual Meeting is the most important science venue for the growing segment of scientists and engineers interested in the latest advances and the influence of science and technology on how we live today. Thousands of leading scientists, engineers, educators, and policymakers interact with one another and with hundreds of members of the national and international media. The growing number of international attendees attests to the increasingly international nature of this gathering. Approximately 150 sessions spread across a dozen tracks are typically presented at the Annual Meeting.</p>
		<p>
		The 2018 meeting will be held February 15-19 in Austin, TX. Scientific session proposals are solicited beginning January 31, 2017. <b><span style="color: red;">The deadline for submission is Thursday, April 20, 2017 at 11:59 p.m. PT.</span> Decisions will be announced in early July 2017 after the completion of external review and final selection by the AAAS Annual Meeting Scientific Program Committee.</b> Proposal organizers are encouraged to be creative and to focus on the uniqueness and interdisciplinary nature of the Annual Meeting.</p>
	<h3>IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ</h3>
		<p>
			The AAAS Annual Meeting Scientific Program Committee is particularly interested in proposals that highlight the theme. However, proposals that are not directly related to the theme will be considered if they involve ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments or new angles for approaching a topic, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, and education. Successful proposals are characterized by:
		<ul style="margin-top:-10px;">
			<li>Interesting, topical subjects that are thoughtfully developed and include capable and articulate speakers who represent the diversity of science and society (including disciplinary field, gender, ethnicity, geographic location, and institution).
			<li>Proposals focused on specific projects or programs are discouraged, unless they significantly emphasize broader applicability.
			<li>Proposals that cover policy are expected to primarily focus on the cutting-edge aspects of the scientific research driving policy in that particular subject, rather than focusing wholly on the issues beyond the science.
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		<b><i>Please see below for submission instructions, and for the specific considerations provided to reviewers.</i></b>
		</p>

			<h1><a name="Step1"></a> Five Steps for Submission</h1>
			<h2><a name="Step1"></a> 1. <u>Set Up Proposal</u></h2>
				<h3>SELECT SESSION TYPE</h3>
				<p>
				<b>Please select the desired session type and adhere to format specifications.</b> The Program Committee reserves the right to accept a proposal contingent on altering the format. 
				</p>
				<p>
				There are three session types: 90-minute <b>symposium</b> format; 90-minute <b>discussion-focused</b> format; and 15-minute <b>"flash talk"</b> format.
				<ul>
					<li><u>90-Minute Symposium Format:</u> This is the standard symposium format. Symposium should be focused on topics and projects with broad appeal and relevancy. A moderated panel composed of 3 speakers give presentations (~20 minutes each), followed by a ~30 minute discussion/Q&A period with the audience. 
					<li><u>90-Minute Discussion-Focused Format:</u> This is a slight variation on the standard symposium format, intended to emphasize discussion and interaction with the audience. Topics where audience input on next steps is desired are encouraged to consider this format. A moderated panel of 2-3 speakers give short presentations (~10 minutes each), followed by a longer (~60 minute) discussion/Q&A period with the audience, either as a full group or in smaller groups. The moderator must be a skilled facilitator; moderator tips and advance support are available. 
					<li><u>15-Minute Flash Talk Format:</u> Flash talks are intended to give individuals the opportunity to provide an introduction to a particular topic or area of research (one speaker only per submission). The Program Committee may group the flash talks by topic or cross-cutting theme, such that 3-5 flash talks may be presented consecutively, followed by a Q&A period with the audience. Video clip of relevant prior talk OR a 3 minute video pitch for your talk are REQUIRED. You may provide either a link/url, or you may upload a video file. 
				</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>ENTER SESSION INFORMATION</h3>
				
				<h3>TITLE OF PROPOSED SCIENTIFIC SESSION</h3>
				<p>
					<u>Title must include no more than 85 characters, including spaces.</u> When preparing a proposal and the title of the session, organizers are encouraged to be creative and to focus on the interdisciplinary nature of the AAAS Annual Meeting. Please avoid jargon.
				</p>

				<h3>SUBMITTER EMAIL ADDRESS</h3>
				<p>
					Please enter a valid email address where messages can be received and accessed year-round. The submitter will immediately receive an email confirming the initiation of a session proposal.</b>
				</p>

				<!-- <p>
					There is one session type: 90-minute format.  The Program Committee reserves the right to accept a proposal contingent on altering the time requested.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>90-Minute Format: See Section 2.</li>
					
				</ul> -->
			

			<h3>CATEGORY SELECTIONS</h3>
				<p>
					Please select the Primary Subject Category that best describes the overall nature of the proposal. This information is used by the Program Committee to help generate broader scientific session tracks or sub-themes. Also, please select Secondary Subject Categories, which are used to develop the cross-cutting General Subject Index contained in the program book.
				</p>

			<h3>SECTION MEMBER AFFILIATION</h3>
				<p>
					If applicable, indicate the primary AAAS section affiliation of the session organizer.
				</p>

			<h3>DISCIPLINARY SECTIONS CONSULTED? <i>(optional)</i></h3>
				<p>
					Indicate if your proposal has been discussed with an AAAS Section. Consultation is not required; however, sections can provide input to help strengthen a proposal, especially if an organizer is submitting for the first time. Consultation does not imply support or endorsement of a proposal. A list of sections and contacts are available at <a href="http://www.aaas.org/page/sections/" target="_blank">http://www.aaas.org/page/sections/</a>.
				</p>

				

			<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>

				<p>
					Provide a clear, succinct synopsis of your proposed scientific session (up to1,500 characters, including spaces) <b>as it would appear in the meeting-program</b>. Avoid the use of report or book references, abbreviations, or technical jargon. Do not repeat the meeting theme’s title in the synopsis. Past Annual Meeting programs are archived at <a href="http://www.aaas.org/annual-meeting/archives/" target="_blank">http://www.aaas.org/annual-meeting/archives</a> and can be a useful source of information.
				</p>

				<p>
					Describe the subject, highlighting the scientific issues, innovations, or research to be addressed. <b>Do not name speakers or the titles of their presentations in the synopsis.</b> Speakers are listed separately along with their presentation titles and descriptions.<!-- (see Step 2) -->.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*Discussion-focused sessions</b> sessions are requested to include in their synopsis whether they plan to hold a moderated, full-group discussion or small group discussions after the presentations. 
				</p>	

			<h3>RELEVANCE TO THEME OR SPECIAL RELEVANCE TO THE AUDIENCE</h3>

				<p>
					Describe how the proposed scientific session relates to the theme (up to 500 characters, including spaces). Almost any topic in science and technology can be related to the theme, and submitters are encouraged to extend their reach by thinking internationally. However, the Program Committee will consider proposals that are not directly related to the theme if they involve ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, and education. 
				</p>

			<h3>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</h3>

				<p>
					AAAS requires clear disclosures from all presenters at its Annual Meeting regarding any affiliations, funding sources, or financial holdings that might raise questions of bias or be perceived to have potentially influenced presentation content. You will be asked to confirm that there are no known conflicts of interest for your speakers or list conflicts of interest. Speakers will also be asked to provide this information at a later date.
				</p>


			<h3>DIVERSITY STATEMENT</h3>

				<p>
					The Program Committee is particularly interested in proposals that include representation of women, international scientists, and underrepresented minorities. Organizers for 90-minute sessions are strongly encouraged to include such participants, as <b>this is a consideration in the selection of sessions by the Program Committee.</b> After proposal selection, if your proposal is conditionally accepted to be included in the Annual Meeting program, the Program Committee may suggest ways to modify the composition of the session to ensure greater diversity among session participants.
				</p>

			<h2><a name="Step2"></a>2. <u>Add/Edit People</u></h2>

			<h3>EXPLANATION OF ROLES</h3>

				<p>
					<b>Please note:</b> If the organizer or co-organizer will also be participating in the session, each separate role must be entered into the system (e.g., organizer and moderator).
				</p>

				<p>	
					<b><u>Organizer</u></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					A session may have only one organizer. The organizer is the primary person responsible for shaping the topic, coordination, and recruitment of participants. The organizer serves as the primary contact for all communications with AAAS Meetings staff. <b>It is the responsibility of the organizer to submit the proposal to AAAS and ensure that participants, including the co-organizer(s) if there is one, receive all information relevant to their inclusion in the proposal and in the Meeting if the proposal is accepted.</b> After proposal acceptance, as necessary, the organizer may suggest addition, removal, or replacement of participants. However, the organizer is responsible for providing, in a timely manner, information regarding any proposed new participants and the reason for the change to AAAS for final approval.
				</p>

				<p>
					For Flash Talks, the Organizer is likely to be the same person as the speaker, unless someone else is submitting it on their behalf; however, as noted above, each role must be entered separately into the system. <i>Organizer and speaker are the only two roles that apply for Flash Talks.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b><u>Speakers</u></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>*90-minute symposia</b> are required to have three (3) speakers.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*90-minute discussion-focused sessions</b> may have two (2) or three (3) speakers. <i>Speakers must not all be from the same institution.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>*Flash talks</b> have only one (1) speaker per proposal submission. The speaker and organizer may be the same person, or they can be different people. <b>A hyperlink to video of the speaker giving a talk is required.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					<u><b>Other Roles</b></u>
				</p>

				<p>	
					<b>Co-Organizer <i>(optional)</i></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Co-organizers may assist the organizer of a 90-minute session with lining up speakers and ensuring that deadlines are met by session participants. There is a maximum of one (1) co-organizer in addition to the mandatory organizer.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Moderator</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Moderators are optional for the symposium format, and <b>required</b> for the discussion format (no more than one moderator per session). <b>AAAS encourages selecting moderators for their skill and experience in facilitating group discussions.</b> The moderator provides a brief overview, introduces each speaker, and facilitates a general discussion by the audience and speakers through a Q&A session. Moderators do not make presentations, submit abstracts, or have a formal speaking role. Please refer to <a href="https://aaas.confex.com/aaas/ModeratorGuidance.pdf">moderator guidance</a> when selecting your moderator. 
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Discussant <i>(optional)</i></b>
				</p>

				<p>
					A maximum of one (1) discussant for a 90-minute session of either type. Discussants provide a brief review of, or counterpoint to, the main topics or issues covered by the panel. They do not make presentations, submit abstracts, or have a formal speaking role.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>PARTICIPANT INFORMATION</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					<u>You will be required to enter the following information for each individual:</u>

							<li>Send speakers information about AAAS Annual Meeting Newsroom requests</li>
						</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<b>Presentation Titles and Descriptions:</b> For each speaker, include a final presentation title (up to 85 characters, including spaces); for example, Domains of Learning and Memory that Are Enhanced with Sleep in Adults. Also, describe the proposed content or perspective of the presentation in a few sentences (up to 500 characters, including spaces). <b>This is crucial to reviewers’ understanding of why you are proposing a particular speaker.</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Please do not submit CVs, biographical information, or formal abstracts for the presenters (beyond the short presentation description). A request to speakers to submit an abstract will be made after the Program Committee has made its program selections. While recognizing that some changes will occur, the committee reserves the right to reconsider sessions if there are speaker substitutions after acceptance of the original proposal.
				</p>


				<p>
					<b>Status: Invited or Confirmed.</b> "Invited" means that you have contacted the speaker, and your invitation is under consideration. "Confirmed" means the speaker has responded to your invitation and confirmed both that they are available during the dates of the meeting, and will participate if the proposal is accepted. After the program decisions are made, AAAS will send notifications to all speakers, whether invited or confirmed, to verify their status and request final confirmation.
				</p>

				<h1><a name="Proposal Review Considerations"></a>Proposal Review Considerations: <u>90-Minute Sessions</u></h1>

					<p>
						The following are considerations that are provided to reviewers. Organizers should carefully follow the instructions for submitting their proposals, which will be evaluated for completeness and clarity. Incomplete proposals (including missing descriptions for the presentations) will not be reviewed. 

						<ol class="numbered">
							<li>Evaluate the proposal in general: Is information adequate for evaluation? Does the proposal clearly describe the session? Is it well organized and coherent? More important, is the proposal complete?</li>
							<li>Evaluate the topic: Is the topic timely? Is it suitable for the AAAS Annual Meeting? Is the topic too narrow for a multidisciplinary audience? The AAAS Annual Meeting Scientific Program Committee is particularly interested in proposals that highlight the theme. However, proposals that are not directly related to the theme will be considered if they involve ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, and education.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the content: Does the proposal cover ground-breaking areas of research, new and exciting developments, or cross-cutting activities in support of science, technology, or education? Does it present new or innovative ideas or approaches to attendees? Is it a policy-related proposal that presents the science underlying policy, or addresses issues of significant importance to research, funding, or collaboration? Consider overall merit and the importance of including the proposed session in the program as well as whether the content is too specialized for an AAAS multidisciplinary audience.</li>
							<li>Evaluate the participants: Are they of a caliber to speak authoritatively on their topic? Is the panel composed of diverse organizations and institutions? Are the presentations integrated and coherent as a group? Does the panel present a balanced perspective?</li>
							<li>Finally, and most important, make an overall judgment about the relative merit of each proposal, expressed as a rank ordering of all the proposals you review, with 1 as the best, 2 the second best, and so on. This rank should be based on the previous four criteria, but it need not be from a mechanical arithmetic average of your communicated scores. Different criteria may figure more or less strongly in your judgment of each proposal, based on the particular nature of that proposal, and this can be reflected in your overall rankings.</li>
